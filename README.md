# Anyware Monitor Deployment

### Script to automatically deploy Anyware Monitor

This script enables automating the installation and registration of Anyware Monitor to Anyware Manager. Please note :

1. Only Windows hosts are supported with this version and the script should be run locally on a Windows host machine.
2. Ensure you have administrator privileges when running the script.
3. After the script is executed Anyware Monitor will be installed and the host is flagged as 'Healthy' in the Anyware Manager Admin Console.
4. Additionally, the "-ignore_cert" parameter can be added to skip certificate validation. In the case of self-signed domains, the config file can be downloaded in the deployment service account tab when editing the current deployment Config file.
